# Snake
  Classic Snake game with multiple difficulty options + golden apples! (God this sounds like an ad)
## How to play
  You will start off choosing a difficulty. Then, off you go to a black screen where you will press enter to proceed to the gameplay.
  Use the arrow keys in order to control the snake. You cannot make the snake go in its opposite direction, such as making it go left when its heading rightwards.
  Albeit, you can't use WASD, dear hopeful Minecraft player. Maybe that will be reserved for something else... I guess? You could make a clone from this repo and then edit the code, you know... and then probably push that to me because I am a horrible coder and my code is like mush...
 ## Pushing and reporting additional features + bugs
  Please, please feel free to push anything you find helpful for this game (I'm desperate for human contact)
